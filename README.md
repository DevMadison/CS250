How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs, you need to put yourself in their shoes. Determine what you would want as a user, research trends, and ask friends who use applications or websites similar to the one youre developing what they like and dislike about it. Most of the time, users want the software to be easy to use and engaging. Creating user stories helps insert yourself better as a user, helping visualize what is best for the user. 
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
To approach developing programs, start slow, study, and do tons of research. Start on small projects first and work your way up. Coding games tend to help a lot with memorizing code. I hope to incorporate the flexibility and efficiency that the agile method brings into my work load, pacing myself on projects and learning to ask for help from other developers, while also using user stories to grasp what is best when designing the program for the user. 
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good team member is to communicate, ask for help when needed, pace yourself and get your work done on time, help others, and always be adaptable to change and open to learning.
